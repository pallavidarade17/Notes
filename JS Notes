1)To replace space with _   eg: "Payment exchange rate" - "Payment_Exchange_Rate"
JSON.parse(x).dimension["0"]["0"].name.replace(/\w+/g, function(txt) {return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1);}).replace(/\s/g, '_')

3)What are closures with example
    A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. 
    The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), 
    it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

      function outer(){
      var x =10;
      function inner(y){
      return x*y;
      }
      return inner;
      }

      var z = outer();
      z(5) Ans===50;
